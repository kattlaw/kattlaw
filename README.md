## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Katherine! Thanks for checking out my GitHub!

#### I design and code applications. My goal is to ensure my projects appeal to all aspects of UX/UI for clients. 

#### I have a passion for front-end development, but I also have experience in back-end programming as well.

#### I specialize in React, Javascript, and CSS to build applications that are tailored towards practical uses in the real world.
